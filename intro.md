# Welcome! üëã

This digital, *interactive* textbook contains the curriculum for Module 2, where we will be using **materials informatics** techniques to study photoactive materials.
This website is intended to be a one-stop-shop where you can access all of the educational materials we'll be using.
We are super excited that you're here and we can't wait to embark on this learning journey with you! üå±


```{warning}
This curriculum is still a work in progress and may be updated at any time. 
When that happens, things may or may not break.
Thank you for your patience and understanding.

## Who are we?   

- [Mark Asta](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/asta/) is a Professor of [Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) who leads a computational materials science [research group](https://asta.mse.berkeley.edu/).
He is also the Director of the [Materials Sciences Division](https://www2.lbl.gov/msd/) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/), and a proud UC Berkeley alum.
- [Enze Chen](https://enze-chen.github.io/) is a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in his group whose research uses atomistic simulations and materials informatics to study the behavior of metal alloys.
He is a proud Stanford alum, but enjoys life on this side of the Bay a lot more.


We both **love teaching**, and while you can think of us as "instructors" or "mentors," know that we're learning alongside you---_from_ all of you---as well.
What a joy.
Go Bears! üêª
