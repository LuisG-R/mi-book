# Welcome! üëã

This digital, *interactive* textbook contains the curriculum for Module 2, where we will be using **materials informatics** (MI) techniques to study photoactive materials.
This website is intended to be a one-stop-shop where you can access all of the educational materials we'll be using.
We are super excited that you're here and we can't wait to embark on this learning journey with you! üå±


```{attention}
This curriculum is still a work in progress and may be updated at any time. 
When that happens, things may or may not break.
Thank you for your patience and understanding.
```


## Who are we?   

- [Mark Asta](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/asta/) is a Professor of [Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.berkeley.edu/) (MSE) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) (UCB) who leads a computational materials science [research group](https://asta.mse.berkeley.edu/).
He is also the Director of the [Materials Sciences Division](https://www2.lbl.gov/msd/) (MSD) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) (LBL), and a proud UCB alum.
- [Enze Chen](https://enze-chen.github.io/) is a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in his group whose research uses atomistic simulations and MI to study the behavior of metal alloys.
He is a proud Stanford University alum, but enjoys life on this side of the Bay a lot more.


We both **love teaching**, and while you can think of us as "instructors" or "mentors," know that we're learning alongside you---_from_ all of you---as well.
What a joy.
Go Bears! üêª

## Navigating the curriculum

For the most part, you can use the navigation panel on the left to jump quickly between sections of this textbook. 
The `Day XX` pages will have a more detailed summary of all of the pages/activities for that day, which can be expanded by clicking the down chevron (‚åÑ).
You can also navigate between adjacent pages using the navigation buttons at the bottom of each page.

Most of the curriculum will be accessible to everyone (the interactive exercises can be completed using Google Colaboratory instead of JupyterHub), although a few special features will require a UC Berkeley login (mostly to avoid spam).
If you want to view the source code of this textbook, you can hover over [Octocat](https://github.com/octocat) in the top-right corner and click {guilabel}`repository` or [click here](https://github.com/enze-chen/mi-book).
