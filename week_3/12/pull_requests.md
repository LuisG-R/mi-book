# GitHub pull requests

In Module 1, you learned a little bit about GitHub and how it can be used to share code between developers and with the general public.
More specifically, you used the command-line interface (CLI) to clone repositories (repos) to your local computing environment.
In this lesson, we'll continue the discussion and explore two more features of GitHub: the **web user interface (UI)** and **pull requests**.



## Web UI

Chances are, you have already seen the GitHub web UI if you've cloned a repo before, because that's where you will find the correct URL to clone.
At the very least you will have glanced it while setting up your GitHub account for this module. (_right???_ üòâ) 
In case you haven't seen a full repo before, [here is the webpage](https://github.com/enze-chen/mi-book) for this textbook's repo as an example.

As you can see, the UI is fairly clean with many symbols, lots of whitespace, and light colors.
This simplicity was [intentionally designed](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-06-23-design-updates-to-repositories-and-github-ui/) to better surface repo elements and key GitHub features.
Moreover, the developers of GitHub realized that in order to elevate GitHub to the next level and increasing platform adoption, they had to start enabling more CLI features to be accessible through the UI.
This not only improves the user experience for everyone (who doesn't like point-and-click, drag-and-drop?), but also enables less programming-savvy users to also collaborate on projects.

On the main page of this textbook's repo, you will notice that one of the most prominent features on the right-hand side is the **Contributors** list.
This panel lists everyone who has made at least one change to at least one file in this repo.
It is sensible for this to be featured since that is one of the purposes of using GitHub and credit should be given where credit is due.
However, you'll also notice that it's a little sad at the moment‚ÄîEnze is the only contributor. üò¢

But fear not!
As stated on the first day, _we are a team_, and a team functions best when everyone contributes, so **you will all soon become contributors** on this wonderful team project of ours. üòç



## Pull requests

In GitHub lingo, the phrase associated with a personal contribution to a project is a **pull request**, or PR.
When you "open a PR" or "submit a PR," what this means is that you made some changes to your personal version of a repo (called a "fork" in GitHub lingo üç¥) and you're ready to incorporate those changes into the main, public version of that repo.
The "pull" part of the name refers to the fact that the main project has to grab your changes, and the "request" part of the name refers to the fact that the maintainers of the project need to review and accept your changes before they can be incorporated.
