# Final presentations

**This is it**!
After three weeks of intense focus on MI, you're ready to showcase what you've learned in your self-directed research projects.
We'll be starting final presentations on Zoom at 3:00PM PDT and you're welcome to invite family and friends to this event! ðŸ™Œ

Before then, please [edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/enze-chen/mi-book/blob/master/week_3/14/final_presentations.md) to add everything in square brackets: 

- Your emoji
- Presentation title
- Description
- A relevant figure that you created

Detailed instructions for how to do this can be found in Tuesday's mini-lesson on {doc}`../12/pull_requests`.

The following presenters are ordered alphabetically by first name.
The actual order of presentations will be determined during today's morning scrum. ðŸ˜‰

_And for everyone else_: Check out the cool projects these students have made! ðŸ˜Ž
