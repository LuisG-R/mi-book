# Giving presentations

One of the final deliverables in this module is a presentation to showcase your work in this module.
Throughout the course of graduate school, you will be giving research-related talks _all the time_.
Depending on the occasion and the audience, these talks will range in technicality and length.
You may want to choose something short and fun when speaking to non-technical audiences, while for a thesis defense you should be prepared to delve into the technical details for up to 3 hours.

For this module, you will be giving a [**science slam**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_slam), which was presumably named after [poetry slams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry_slam) and [spoken word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_word).
In the same vein, a science slam is a short oral presentation that is given to non-expert audiences, where the focus is on communicating your work in a way that generates excitement and impresses impact, even when the audience isn't too familiar with your field.
It attempts to engage broader audiences in science by breaking down some of the formality and jargon and is great practice for science communication!

Please be aware that when we say "non-experts," we don't [necessarily] mean a "non-technical audience without a science background."
All of us (interns and mentors!), for example, are "non-experts" in all but a few fields, but we are still considered a "technical audience" as we know a thing or two about science. ðŸ˜œ
We will be the primary audience for your presentation, so keep that in mind when preparing your content.
When in doubt, error on the side of less technicality.

**Also keep in mind**

No one:

Literally nobody: 

_Not a single soul_:

Reviewer #2: I don't like your presentation because it is too entertaining.

## Example SLAM

There are many great examples of science slams on YouTube, but out of convenience more than anything else, here we've included a slam talk that Enze gave as part of his _remote summer research internship_ (hey, sound familiar? ðŸ˜‰) last year at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/).

Some things to take note of:

- He was limited to only three minutes and three technical slides!
Not a lot of room to squeeze content in.
- For the content that he did fit in, note that it was still technically rigorous (microstructure, density functional theory, thermodynamics, etc.), but kept at a high level without going into the details.
This is _expected_ and the focus is on crafting a cohesive narrative (but you still gotta pack some meat in).
- Note the heavy use of figures and light use of text.
You should similarly use figures and animations to tell your story, with clarifying text when needed (like axes labels).
Note how on the second slide Enze took an existing figure he made and modified the axes to facilitate communication of the main idea.
- Similar to your situation, Enze had to make this presentation just four weeks into his ten-week summer internship.
And so you can see that while there were one or two preliminary results, a lot of time was spent on context, motivation, impact, and future directions of the work.
You can do the same in your SLAM.
- There were some "fun" icons, jokes, and personal quirks inserted into the presentation. 
You can consider doing the same as that's the whole purpose of slams!
