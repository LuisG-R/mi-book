```{admonition} Did you know?
:class: tip
What is the difference between a black hole and graduate school admissions?
One is said to be so complex, so dense, so opaque that no information ever escapes it.
The other is an astronomical object. 😁
```

One of the main goals of this entire summer internship—and why you chose to sign up—is to give you all some research experience and for you to see what life as a graduate researcher is like.
By now, you have already accumulated significant experience working with EUV lithography, MI, MATLAB, and Python—with DFT and ferroelectrics to come(!)—and maybe, _just maybe_, you feel like this is where you belong. 😊
But maybe as you thought a little deeper, you realized that situated squarely on the path between where you are now and your [potential] future life as a graduate student is the nebulous fog that is graduate school admissions.
Like undergraduate admissions (unfortunately), the process is anything but clear and rife with pain points, inequities, and pitfalls. 
Unlike undergraduate admissions (unfortunately), there is also a different set of evaluation criteria that almost surely has changed in light of recent events.
What the process is like now is anyone's guess. 🤷‍

And who better to discuss all this [and more] with than our very own?
As you know from the introduction, Mark is currently a Professor of MSE at UCB and Director of MSD at LBL.
What you may not know is that previously Mark served as Chair of the [UCB MSE department](https://mse.berkeley.edu/) (2012-2018) and before that held professorships at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/materials-science/) (2000-2005) and [UC Davis](https://mse.engineering.ucdavis.edu/) (2005-2009).
He has been on several graduate admissions committees (and chaired a few) and has mentored dozens of undergraduate and graduate students in his academic career.
Bring your energy and questions for Mark as we get a special opportunity to hear about what it's all like _from a man on the inside_. 👀
