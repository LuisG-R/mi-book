# Day 01: Introductions


Welcome to the first day of Module 2! 
We're excited to learn with you. ðŸ™Œ

```{attention}
If you haven't done so already, please make sure that you've completed the [introductory survey](https://forms.gle/nUJkB7cPyiQBMDxm8) and completed the {doc}`../../preamble/setup` instructions.
```

We also invite you to read through the {doc}`../../preamble/overview` and the condensed {doc}`Schedule <../../preamble/schedule>` to get a feel for what we'll be doing in this module. 
If you don't have time to do so, not to worry---we will clarify <s>everything</s>most things today. ðŸ™‚



## Goals for today

- Get to know one another better and our motivations for being here.
- Discuss the structure of this module and clarify the expectations.
- Introduce materials informatics at a high level.
- Introduce the Python programming language and how we will use it in this module.
- Get ample practice with Python and the Jupyter environment, including:
    - Common syntax, data types, and data structures
    - Working with files
    - Scientific computing in NumPy



## Timing for today
