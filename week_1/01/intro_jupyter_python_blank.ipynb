    "\n",
    "The main design philosophy behind Jupyter notebooks could be summarized as the following: A platform for creating _computational narratives_ to promote _literate computing_.\n",
    "The creators of Project Jupyter, one of whom is UC Berkeley Statistics Professor [Fernando P√©rez](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-perez), wanted to create a tool that made computational research easier to communicate and more reproducible, which led to the development of Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "The interleaving of code with prose and graphics has made programming a lot more accessible to general audiences and the interactivity of these notebooks also makes them great teaching tools!"

    "### Organization of Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The information in Jupyter notebooks is organized into **cells**, which come in many forms.\n",
    "This cell is called a **Markdown cell**, which is used for text that can be formatted with the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) markup language.\n",
    "This is a fairly simple, yet extremely powerful markup language that allows you to do most of the basic styles, such as add emphasis, make itemized lists, create headings, write inline code, add links, include external images, and use HTML (see [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a cheat sheet).\n",
    "You know this is a Markdown cell because when you select this cell (click on it such that a <font color=\"blue\">blue bar</font> appears on the left), the menu bar at the top shows \"`Markdown  v`\" in the second row:\n",
    "\n",
    "![jupyter_menu](../../assets/fig/week_1/01/jupyter_menu.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, here is an itemized list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go\n",
    "- Fight\n",
    "- Win!\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is a code block _in the Markdown cell_ with Python syntax highlighting:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello, World!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you love $\\LaTeX$ as much as we do, it can handle that too. üòç"
