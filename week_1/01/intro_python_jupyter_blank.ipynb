    "### Using Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we're going to take a somewhat practical approach to using Python, in the sense that we view it as just another tool in our toolbox for expanding our understanding of materials.\n",
    "We'll discuss Python concepts, syntax, and style along the way, but the _focus_ will always be on applying it to solve relevant MSE problems in a data-driven fashion.\n",
    "Therefore, our focus as mentors will be to teach you only what's relevant for this module, and unfortunately won't have much time to extensively cover the details of the language or various packages during the tutorials (you're welcome to ask in OH!).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this strategy risks leaving you with only a cursory understanding of Python, we want to offer two points of solace and why this might not actually be the case:\n",
    "1. Based on the initial survey, many of you have some programming experience already, even if it's in a different language. \n",
    "We think you'll be surprised to find that, both at a theoretical and applied level, Python is not _too_ different from other languages that you may have seen (e.g., C++, MATLAB) and that a lot of your prior knowledge will transfer to help you understand Python.\n",
    "1. Solving scientific problems algorithmically (e.g., in a data-driven way) often requires a lot more than being able to program, irrespective of the programming language. \n",
    "Therefore, while we're teaching you Python programming syntax and tools, what we're really hoping to communicate is a _way of thinking_ like a computer, which is quite different than the way humans think.\n",
    "And so you might find that you're spending more time _formulating_ data-driven solutions than actually _writing code_.\n",
    "A little planning goes a long way.\n",

    "### Running Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can _write_ Python code just about anywhere (even in Microsoft Word, lol), but in order to _execute_ the code, you will need a Python **kernel**.\n",
    "For this module (at least, for these tutorials), we will use Jupyter notebooks for running the Python code we write."

    "\n",
    "The main design philosophy behind Jupyter notebooks could be summarized as the following: A platform for creating _computational narratives_ to promote _literate computing_.\n",
    "The creators of Project Jupyter, one of whom is UC Berkeley Statistics Professor [Fernando P√©rez](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-perez), wanted to create a tool that made computational research easier to communicate and more reproducible, which led to the development of Jupyter notebooks.\n",
