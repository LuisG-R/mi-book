# Day 03: Data visualization

Welcome to day üïí of this module, where we will be learning an important yet often neglected skill: data visualization. 
You'll find that the process of making compelling visualizations is not-too-hard when done programmatically and _easily_ makes you stand out amongst your peers. üòè



## Goals for today

- Learn how to visualize data programmatically using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) in Python.
- Identify best practices for data visualizations.



## Timing for today

- We will kick off the day on Zoom at 9:00AM _sharp_.
- We will have a mix of synchronous lectures and group exercises, interspersed with several short breaks.
- We will take a longer break for lunch between 12:00PM and 1:00PM.
- Enze will hold drop-in OH from 2:00PM to 3:00PM on Zoom.
- Enze will also hold tea time from 3:00PM to 3:20PM at the same Zoom link as an opportunity for all of us to take a break from work and socialize over something _other than research_.
Attendance is optional, but recommended (you can also join for just part of the time).
BYOB is _also_ optional, but _highly_ recommended. üçµ
- We will convene for a quick debrief on Zoom at 4:00PM.
