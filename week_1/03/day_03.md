# Day 03: Data visualization

Welcome to day üïí of this module, where we will be learning an important yet often neglected skill: data visualization. 
You'll find that the process of making compelling visualizations is not-too-hard when done programmatically and _easily_ makes you stand out amongst your competitors. üòè



## Goals for today

- Learn how to visualize data programmatically using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) in Python.
- Identify best practices for data visualizations.
- Discuss advanced visualizations and what insights we can draw from them.



## Timing for today

- We will kick off the day on Zoom at 9:00AM PDT _sharp_.
- We will have a mix of synchronous lectures and group exercises, interspersed with several short breaks.
- We will take a longer break for lunch between 12:00PM and 1:00PM PDT.
- We will convene for a quick debrief on Zoom at 4:30PM PDT.
