    "We want to give you ample hands-on practice working with different file types so that you:\n",
    "1. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of each file format.\n",
    "1. Are prepared to work with your own datasets during self-directed research.\n",
    "1. Build comfort with and learn best practices for working with programmatic tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will progress through most of this exercise together as a group, but if there's a part that's particularly tricky, feel free to review it on your own time.\n",
    "As always, we're happy to hear from you if you have any questions.\n",
