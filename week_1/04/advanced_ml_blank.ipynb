    "\n",
    "**Idea 1**: Because we're proud of democracy, we might consider an algorithm that trains not one, not two, but _many_ decision trees and then have them \"vote\" on the final prediction.\n",
    "By \"vote,\" we mean we take the _mode_ of the predictions from every decision tree if it's a _classification_ task, and the _mean_ of the predictions from every decision tree if it's a _regression_ problem.\n",
    "In other words, we are **aggregating** the outputs and performance of an **ensemble** of decision trees—two heads are better than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea 2**: But wait!\n",
    "If we use the same training data for training each decision tree in this ensemble model, we're actually going to end up with pretty similar (**correlated**) trees... which means we'll perform the same as using just one decision tree.\n",
    "How can we inject some variation... maybe with some randomness?\n",
    "Let's **bootstrap** the training data, which means from the $m$ data points in our whole training dataset, we will **randomly sample with replacement** $m$ examples to form the training dataset for decision tree #1, randomly sample a different set of $m$ examples for training decision tree #2, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea 3**: The fun doesn't have to stop there.\n",
    "We know that when we have a lot of features (degrees of freedom), we increase the model complexity and run the risk of overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "So, maybe when we're deciding which feature to split on at each node, we can just consider **a subset of the features** instead of all the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This subset can be a randomly-sampled portion (w/o replacement is fine) of the features at each decision node in every decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining ideas 1 and 2 is called **bagging** (**b**ootstrap **agg**regat**ing**), and when we combine them with idea 3 to create an ensemble model of decision trees, we get one of the 🐐 ML algorithms: **random forests**.\n",
    "An earlier version of this algorithm was invented by [Tin Kam Ho](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-tho) in 1995, while more-or-less the exact version described here was [invented in 2001 by Leo Breiman](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324), who was a UC Berkeley PhD student ('54) and Professor of Statistics for 25 years! 🐻"

    "In unsupervised learning, we're no longer concerned about any target property/label, but rather we're curious about the **inherent structure** in the data, such as whether there are clusters or trends along certain features.\n",
