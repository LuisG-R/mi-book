# Day 04: ML speedrun

Welcome to day üçÄ of Module 2 where we will finally learn about the granddaddy of them all: **machine learning (ML)**.
We'll discuss the general, foundational principles as well as special considerations for MI.
And we'll do it all in one day.
It'll be fun. üòé

```{attention}
Today's synchronous activities _will almost surely_ take the whole day. Get pumped!! üí™
```


## Goals for today

- Introduce fundamental concepts and terms associated with [supervised] ML.
- Practice implementing these concepts using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) in Python.
- Discuss some advanced ML models and the intuition behind them so we can identify their utility.
- Discuss practical considerations when doing ML (for MSE, and more broadly).



## Timing for today

- We will kick off the day on Zoom at 9:00AM _sharp_.
- We will have a mix of synchronous lectures and group exercises, interspersed with several short breaks.
- We will take a longer break for lunch between 12:00PM and 1:00PM.
- We will also take a break from 3:00PM to 3:20PM.
- Since we'll be meeting online for the whole day, we'll debrief as part of the last session.
