# Day 02: MI and data

Welcome to day âœŒ of Module 2 where we will take a deeper dive into the field of MI with a particular emphasis on data types, data representation, and data storage.
As we discussed yesterday, there will be many hands-on exercises for you in these lessons to build confidence and expertise working with programming tools.
