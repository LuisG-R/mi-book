## Reading  

To recap some of the topics presented today in preparation for self-directed research, we suggest a few papers below on dielectric datasets and what one might do with that data that might be of interest to you.
We also include a paper discussing how to avoid making misleading visualizations in preparation for tomorrow's lessons.
These papers can all be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FuZJyp1yWqoMXNs0_1s8LtSzPUwC5CpM?usp=sharing).


1. The dielectric constants dataset on Materials Project (MP) by Ioannis Petousis et al. {cite}`petousis_2017`.
    - We _strongly recommend_ reading the paper in its entirety because it gives a comprehensive (and not-too-specialized) discussion about the data format, the underlying science, and some interesting trends that can motivate your self-directed research.
    It's not too long and mostly has tables and figures.
    - (optional) A related dataset by Guido Petretto et al. on _phonon_ calculations, something that we did not talk about, but may be of interest to you {cite}`petretto_2018`.
1. The perspective by [Danielle Szafir](https://danielleszafir.com/) on data visualization {cite}`szafir_2018`.
    - There are many pretty pictures and should be a fun read!
    Just reading the figure captions is fine.
1. (optional) The [Ramprasad group](http://ramprasad.mse.gatech.edu/) (now at Georgia Tech) has published a dataset on hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites by Chiho Kim et al. {cite}`kim_2017`.
1. (optional) Those interested in polymer dielectrics (MP is mostly concerned with inorganic materials) may be interested in the work by Tran Huan et al. also from the Ramprasad group {cite}`huan_2016`.
1. (optional) Examples of the information that can be mined from such databases include the works by Ethan Shapera and [AndrÃ© Schleife](http://schleife.matse.illinois.edu/) {cite}`shapera_2018` and [Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MSE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=239950) et al. {cite}`mannodi-kanakkithodi_2017`.
    - These might require a little more physics background to fully comprehend and appreciate.
    The Kasap textbook might be helpful in this regard.

Again, to make your reading experience a little more interactive and to allow for more targeted questions, we'll experiment with leaving comments _directly on the PDF_ in Google Drive.
You're welcome to ask/answer questions, share observations/reactions, link related content, etc.
Participation is _optional_, but encouraged if you do have questions or thoughts to share. ðŸ˜Š
Enze will periodically check the Google Drive to respond to your comments.



## Programming

Today's programming assignment is intended to review the data topics that we discussed.
They're _much shorter_ than yesterday's notebooks and reinforce tabular data ([pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)) and the MP API ([Pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org/)).
