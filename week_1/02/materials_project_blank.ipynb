    "What an API does is that it gives a way for your computer to communicate with a database through a series of actions that you _call_.\n",
    "One benefit of having an API is that it hides away the implementation details of the database and you can focus on getting the data you need, with the method of your choice—like Python!\n",

    "APIs that obey these principles are termed \"RESTful\" and they allow the data to be queried with **unique resource IDs** in a uniform manner.\n",

    "\n",
    "All operating systems have a set of environment variables that programs will reference (such as `$HOME` or `$PATH`), and it's possible to add to this list by creating your own environment variables.\n",
