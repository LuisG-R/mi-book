# Proposals

Since one of the learning outcomes of this module is to strengthen your scientific communication skills, we will have a small writing assignment where you will practice writing a short proposal for your research.
Proposals are fixtures in academic research and they're most often written when **applying for funding**, such as for an individual fellowship or project grant.
The purpose of a proposal is to construct a coherent and convincing narrative of your planned work such that the reviewers at the funding agency will be convinced to fund _your_ project and _not someone else's_. üèÜ

It might seem a little weird that you have to describe your entire project, including anticipated results, just to secure funding _to then actually be able to carry out the project_, but this is probably the most objective way to determine how money should be sensibly allocated.
Writing a proposal will also help you get a sense of what needs to be accomplished in what sequence, and what pain points might be encountered along the way.
Our hope is that by writing a short proposal, you will gain clarity on:

- The specific steps you need take towards answering your research question.
- What steps are easier and what steps are harder.
- How your approach fits into the bigger picture (e.g., what are the [_broader impacts_](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/special/broaderimpacts/)).



## Proposal structure

Full research proposals span anywhere from two to two dozen pages depending on the funding opportunity.
We will not ask for something that long.
Instead, we ask that you write a proposal roughly between **150-300 words**, not including {ref}`h2:08:headers` and {ref}`h2:08:references`.
These are soft limits, meant as a guide to ensure you 1) have sufficient ideas to tell a complete story, but 2) don't go overboard and write a 5-page essay.



(h2:08:headers)=
### Headers

There are two things you need in the header area of your proposal.

**Title**: Come up with a title for your proposal that is between 5-15 words.
You can look up guidance on how to phrase the title, and we suggest writing the title _after_ you've written the body of your proposal.

**Author**: This is you! 
Write your name and affiliation underneath the title, where the affiliation is generally your department name and your school's address.
For example, on Enze's proposals/papers/presentations, he would write:
```markdown
Enze Chen
Department of Materials Science and Engineering
University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720
```



### Content

What actually goes into the body of a proposal? 
The bullets we list below might not apply to every proposal (here's [the proposal guide](https://foundry.lbl.gov/user-program/proposal-guide/proposal-questions-and-evaluation-criteria/) from LBL's [Molecular Foundry](https://foundry.lbl.gov/)), but we try to include the salient features in a sensible order:
- What is the scientific problem you're trying to address and why is it significant?
- What has already been done (by you or others) to try and solve this problem?
- What are you proposing to do? 
    - Typically this has novelty to it, but don't worry about it for this proposal.
    - Typically this also has a timeline consideration (i.e., is what you're proposing feasible for the funding period?), but we only have two weeks, lol. So you can dream a little bigger. üôÇ
- Why are you the right person for this job?
    - Typically this includes previous experience, particularly publications. 
    But that's not really relevant here, so feel to free to list previous courses, previous experiences, things you've learned in this module, and/or why this problem is so important to _you_.
- What is the metric for success?
- What will be the impact of this work on science/society?



### Figures

Generally speaking, it is helpful to include a figure in the proposal; in some cases, you even _need one_ if you want to have a shot of winning.
We encourage you to try and find a suitable figure that illustrates some idea in your proposal.
This could be:
- A figure you generated regarding some data you found (e.g., what we practiced in week 1).
- A figure describing the steps you're taking (e.g., with boxes and arrows).
- A figure/illustration of something cool made by someone else, which we'll allow for this assignment as long as it's properly cited.



(h2:08:references)=
## References

We ask that you include **at least two citations** in your proposal.
This gives you practice searching for relevant literature (see {doc}`../../week_1/05/reading_papers`), building your ideas off of others, and giving proper attributions.
There are several papers in [the Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FuZJyp1yWqoMXNs0_1s8LtSzPUwC5CpM?usp=sharing) and you can refer to the week 1 pages (like {doc}`../../week_1/02/databases`) for how to format your references.
