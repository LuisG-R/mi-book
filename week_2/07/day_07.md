# Day 07: Research

Welcome back! 
We hope you enjoyed the long weekend.
It's the start of week 2, and from here on out, we will be applying the concepts and tools we learned in the first week (along with your prior knowledge) towards answering the research question of interest to you.



## Goals for today

- Check in to see how we're all doing after last week's whirlwind of learning.
- Roadmap the remaining two weeks of this module.
- Start working on your self-directed research projects.



## Timing for today

- We will start the day with morning scrum on Zoom at 9:00AM PDT _sharp_.
- Enze will hold drop-in office hours (OH) from 2:00PM to 3:00PM PDT at the same Zoom link if you want to chat about your project or _anything else_ in this module.
Attendance is optional, as you need it.
- Enze will also hold tea time from 3:00PM to 3:20PM PDT at the same Zoom link as an opportunity for all of us to take a break from work and socialize over something _other than_ research.
Attendance is optional, but recommended (you can also join for only part of the time).
BYOB is _also_ optional, but _highly_ recommended. üçµ
- We will convene for a quick debrief on Zoom at 4:30PM PDT.
