# Homework



## Reading  

These papers can all be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FuZJyp1yWqoMXNs0_1s8LtSzPUwC5CpM?usp=sharing).


1. We recommend revisiting [the paper by Petousis et al.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGQ7G8n_DrLdpsC9e72gb3eKSAGP5-AU/view?usp=sharing) on the dielectric constants dataset. 
Even if you read it once before, it never hurts to do another pass!
1. (optional) [The review article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cLXY2B3ZAPKHfLrwlsyCVMVfVQzDIEac/view?usp=sharing) by J. Robertson on "High dielectric constant oxides" {cite}`robertson_2004`.
    - This is a pretty hefty article that goes deep into bonding, interfaces, defects, band structures... so please only **skim** up to and including Section 2.4.
    This will help set the stage for tomorrow's discussion of research and materials selection/screening, where Mark will explain most of the scientific concepts in more detail.



## Programming

There are no specific programming assignments today, although we do recommend reviewing the ML exercises from today, which covered quite a lot of information in a very short amount of time.
If you want to get a deeper understanding of cost functions and optimization, we invite you to look at the gradient descent section.
