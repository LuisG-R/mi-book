## Reading  

These papers can all be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FuZJyp1yWqoMXNs0_1s8LtSzPUwC5CpM?usp=sharing).


1. The review article by J. Robertson on "High dielectric constant oxides" {cite}`robertson_2004`.
    - This is a pretty hefty article that goes deep into bonding, interfaces, defects, band structures... so please only read **Section 1 and 2**.
    You can skim these sections to get a rough idea, as it will help set the stage for tomorrow's discussion of research and materials selection/screening.



## Programming

There are no specific programming assignments today, although we do recommend reviewing the ML exercises from today, which covered quite a lot of information in a very short amount of time.
Particularly interesting would be looking at gradient descent and classification algorithms on your own.
<!-- - You can start looking at tomorrow's {doc}`../05/best_practices_blank` notebook if you want, as it's a nice summary of a lot of the things we covered in this first week. -->
