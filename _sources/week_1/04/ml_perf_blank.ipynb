    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix given a target vector $\\vec{y}$ and predicted classes $\\hat{y}$ can be computed using the function [`confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html), which returns a matrix of dimension $\\text{num_classes} \\times \\text{num_classes}$ with element $(i,j)$ being the number of samples with true label $i$ and predicted label $j$.\n",
    "Note that **the order of the two input vectors matters**!\n",
    "Also, if the labels are numerical (e.g., `0`, `1`), then the output confusion matrix is sorted from smallest to largest, so it might help to explicitly pass a `labels=[1, 0]` argument to fix the label order for the final confusion matrix [to match what we had above].\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy can be computed by hand from the above confusion matrix, or if we want to directly compute it from the true classes $\\vec{y}$ and predicted classes $\\hat{y}$, we can use the [`accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html) function.\n",
