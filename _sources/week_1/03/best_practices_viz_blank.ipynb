    "It can save `ImportError`s later on in the notebook.\n",

    "But it was pretty cumbersome to have to change it _every time_ (lots of typing) and we can easily forget something.\n",

    "\"rc\" is an acronym for \"run commands\" which refer to startup information on Unix systems, and they govern matplotlib behavior as well.\n",
