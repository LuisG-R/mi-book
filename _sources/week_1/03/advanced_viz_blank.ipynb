    "\n",
    "You'll notice that a differentiator between the plots you created above and the ones in the paper is the separation based on crystal structure.\n",
    "One way to \"easily\" figure out the crystal structure of a material is with the [space group number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_group#Table_of_space_groups_in_3_dimensions).\n",
    "But... we don't have the space group number... yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: Expand your dataset by getting the space group number of each material.\n",
    "You can do this in many ways, and we suggest two possible paths:\n",
    "1. You can look in the original dataset (JSON file) to try and extract the space group number, which is buried in the file.\n",
    "This is a good exercise.\n",
    "1. OR you can use Pymatgen to construct a query for the space group of all of your materials (possible with a criteria on the material ID).\n",
    "This is also a good exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add the space group number to your DataFrame / tabular dataset of the dielectric constants.\n",
    "Then save this dataset into a file since you've improved it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: After this, what you then need is a function that can convert the space group number into the crystal system.\n",
    "This should be very similar to a function that you've already written on the first day, so no more hints on this part. ðŸ˜‰\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Finally, to plot each set of crystal structures separately (say, a different color for each one on a scatter plot), we can group the data in the DataFrame by crystal structure using the [`df.groupby()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) method.\n",
    "You might want to use it in this way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "groups = df.groupby(['crystal_structure'])\n",
    "for name, group in groups:\n",
    "    ax.scatter(group['band_gap'], group['refractive_index'], label=name)\n",

    "It must be said that this particular extension has a lot of new ideas thrown at you all at once.\n",
    "What we recommend you pay attention to is not finishing all the steps, but rather why we chose this sequence of steps, and how we broke down a complex problem (here's a plot, go make it!) into a series of more manageable steps.\n",
    "Note that we started with something that we already had access to, and then brought in more data as we needed.\n",
    "You might find yourself doing something similar, _but not exactly the same_ in your own work, so it's much more important that you mirror the thought process, rather than the concrete code."
