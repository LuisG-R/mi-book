    "### Create Figure and Axes objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: There are many ways to create figures using Pyplot, but in true OOP fashion, the **best practice** is to create [`Figure`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure) and [`Axes`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes) objects using the [`plt.subplots()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html) function like so:\n",

    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",

    "The `Figure` (`fig` variable) is the top-level container for all plot elements while the `Axes` (`ax` variable) is the object for a particular plot (this is _not_ the plural form of the word \"axis\").\n",
    "`plt.subplots()` creates both of these objects, which we then assign to the variables on the left.\n",
    "Imagine this step as the IRL-equivalent of saying, \"Before we can paint a painting, we must fetch a new canvas.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: To make a plot, we can call a method like [`ax.plot(x, y)`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot.html) **directly using the `Axes` object**‚Äî_not_ the `Figure` object or the Pyplot module (unlike MATLAB).\n",
    "This standard method plots $y$ vs. $x$ points and, by default, connects the points with lines in the order that they're plotted.\n",
    "Note the syntax for `ax.plot()` is a list (or array) of $x$-coordinates and _then_ a list of $y$-coordinates, **not** a list of $(x,y)$ pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Finally, and perhaps unintuitively, we have to call [`plt.show()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.show.html) to actually display the plot.\n",

    "#### Improving visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: Perhaps one of your first criticisms of the demo plots was that they're too small!\n",
    "This can be easily fixed by adding `figsize=(width, height)` as an input argument to `plt.subplots()`, where `width` and `height` are numbers representing \"inches.\" \n",
    "We recommend **enlarging your plots** to `(8, 6)` to start with, and adjust based on personal preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: Another improvement to plot visibility is increasing the thickness of your lines.\n",
    "To change this, add a `linewidth=width` parameter to your call to `ax.plot()`, where `width` is a number.\n",
    "We recommend a line width of **at least `4`**, which you can assign to a `CONSTANT` variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step \"3\"**: Finally, you'll notice that if you _only_ increase the size of your figure, then the font size remains small.\n",
    "To increase the font size, you have to add `fontsize=size` to _every function call that adds text_ to your plot.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax.set_title('my title', fontsize=size)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We recommend a font size of **at least `20`**.\n",
    "If this seems cumbersome, that's because it is‚Äîwe'll discuss a better option in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3.5**: This is very subtle, but you'll notice that the $x$- and $y$-ticks are _also_ labeled, but you never called a function to label them(!), which means their font needs to be increased in a different way.\n",
    "To do this, we use the [`ax.tick_params()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick_params.html) method like so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax.tick_params(labelsize=size)    # note the different keyword!\n",
    "```\n",
    "The documentation reveals that this method is quite flexible, but we can just use the other default options for now, which includes changing the label size for both $x$ and $y$ axes."

    "Instead, we can take advantage of a built-in method from pandas, [`df.corr()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html), which computes the pairwise correlation of all the numerical columns and returns a **matrix** of correlations.\n",
