# Homework

Today's lesson was meant to be pretty light to give you all a break from the first two days and from the marathon coming up tomorrow. üòÅ

## Reading  

Today's reading consists of three papers, all of which can be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FuZJyp1yWqoMXNs0_1s8LtSzPUwC5CpM?usp=sharing).

1. The first is a short 2-page paper on, well, how to read a paper, by S. Keshav {cite}`keshav_2007`. More information can be found on the previous page, {doc}`reading_papers`.
    - We recommend taking a look so that all of your future readings will feel more bearable and productive.
1. The second is a paper by Chad Parish and Philip Edmondson discussing data visualization best practices _specifically_ for materials data {cite}`parish_2019`, which is pretty niche and pretty neat.
    - We are including this article for your interest and we don't plan on discussing it at length, but you're welcome to bring it up.
    - We recommend reading the Introduction (Section 1), skimming the rest of the text if you want, and reading the figures to see the cool kinds of materials data that exist.
    Basically, it's a cool paper for the pretty pictures, but you shouldn't spend too much time on it.
1. The third is a review paper by Keith Butler et al. on the topic of machine learning in materials science {cite}`butler_2018`, and arguably one of the best review papers in MI.
    - This is an _advanced_ article with several challenging concepts, but we **strongly recommend you read all of it**.
    It's OK if very little (or none) of it makes sense at the moment.
    The last section (Frontiers in machine learning) is less important for our purposes.
    - We recommend employing some of the techniques discussed in the Keshav paper to help get process this paper in multiple reads.
    - Please feel free to ask questions, look stuff up online, and we'll also spend some time tomorrow dissecting it.
        - _Protip_: When looking up ML (or any technical) concepts, we recommend searching for "topic X _intuition_" or "topic X _explained_."

As you read, feel free to also leave comments _directly on the PDF_ in Google Drive: ask/answer questions, share observations/reactions, link related content, etc.
Participation is _optional_, but encouraged if you do have questions or thoughts to share. üòä
Enze will periodically check the Google Drive to respond to your comments.



## Programming

There are no specific programming assignments for today's tutorial, although we do have some suggestions if you're looking for more practice/ideas:
- Review any of the notebooks we've covered so far, both in live sessions and ones that were assigned for homework.
We see all of these concepts as ones that are important for the practice of MI and, consequently, for your self-directed research.
- Based on what we've discussed about dielectric materials and the reading materials that we've shared, _try to find an application of interest to you and identify what data you'll need_.
- Try to organize the data into a sensible format and perform some exploratory data analysis‚Äîstats and plots!
