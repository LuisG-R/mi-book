# Day 05: MI research

Welcome to day üñê of Module 2 where we will pivot from discussing programmatic tools to identifying research questions for data-driven design of dielectrics and semiconductors. 
We want you to think hard about your choice of research question such that by the end of the day, you will have come up with an _initial_ direction of study (and then go relax over the holiday weekend!).



## Goals for today

- Discuss what MI research involves.
- Brainstorm with peers topics of interest to you.

```{admonition} Milestone

Again, it's totally OK if things change!
