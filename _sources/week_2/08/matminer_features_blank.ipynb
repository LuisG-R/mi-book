    "\n",
    "So far, it sounds like everyone is off to a good start and thinking deeply about what properties might exhibit correlations with the dielectric constant $\\varepsilon$.\n",
    "This is a really important step at the beginning of any data-driven pipeline and it's good practice for you to assemble the code infrastructure for a few manual cases before jumping into an automated approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, you're probably running out of materials properties that are present \"by default\" in MP, so it's time to think about what **new features** we can generate (also called **feature engineering**) from the data that is there.\n",
    "We want these features to be **physically meaningful**, so we'll take a look at the chemical formula and crystal structure and how we can use [featurizers from matminer](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/featurizer_summary.html) to convert these objects into new features.\n",
