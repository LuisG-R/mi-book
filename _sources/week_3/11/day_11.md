# Day 11: Research + grad school

We hope everyone had a great weekend and welcome to day 11 of Module 2.
We are now in the home stretch ðŸ˜¢, so it's time to start thinking about our final project presentations.
But also, to kick off the final week, Mark will be leading a Q&A on all things graduate school related, so you _definitely_ don't want to miss this!



## Goals for today

- Continue working on your self-directed research projects.
- Discuss tips for effective presentations.
- Learn about the [unwritten] rules and [unspoken] details ðŸ˜‰ of the graduate school sagaâ€”from preparation, to admissions, to experience.



## Timing for today

- We will start the day with morning scrum on Zoom at 9:00AM.
- Mark will host a discussion on Zoom (same link) from 10:00AM to 11:00AM.
