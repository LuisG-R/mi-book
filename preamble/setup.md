```{important}
_Estimated time: 10-30 minutes_. 
We greatly appreciate you taking the time to complete these tasks _before_ the first day we meet (Monday, June 28th). üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If you have any questions or encounter difficulties, please don't hesitate to ping us! 
```


## Sign up for accounts

Thanks to the great minds behind [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), many of whom are here at UC Berkeley(!), we don't have to worry about installing any additional software on our personal computers.
However, in order to take full advantage of all of the interactive features in this curriculum, we do ask that you sign up for online accounts on the following platforms.
We will provide detailed instructions with screenshots in each section to help guide you.


### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform where people can store the code they write inside _repositories_ that can then be shared with the public.
There are many good reasons for sharing code, including starting collaborations, showcasing your skills, broadening your impact, etc.
This textbook, for example, is hosted on GitHub! üòâ

GitHub is loaded with cool features, and in this module, we will expose a few of those in the web user interface (UI). 
Therefore, we ask that you sign up for a GitHub account by going to: https://github.com/join

```{note}
If you already have a GitHub account, you do not have to create a new account and should just use your existing one.
```

If you click the previous link, you should be taken to a page that looks like:

```{image} ../assets/fig/preamble/github_join.png
:alt: github_join
:align: center
:width: 66%
```    
&nbsp;   

Enter a username, email, and password that you can remember.
You can probably uncheck the "Email preferences" box.
Verify that you're a human and then click "Create account."

#### Test GitHub account

You may recall from your previous classes or just common sense that it's a good idea to conduct tests to make sure that your software (or in this case, our account) is behaving as expected.
Hover over the [Octocat](https://github.com/octocat) button (the GitHub logo) in the top right corner of this page and click "üí°`open issue`."
If it successfully opens an issue for you, then your account is all set up and you can move on.
There's no need to submit the issue (you can just close the tab), unless you actually have an issue.
